To enter files into a folder, edit the file, and in the name type:
  [FolderName]/[FileName]

You can just add the folder name to the front end of the existing file name, followed by a "/"
If you want to create a new file, it's the same format, but with the new file name.

I created readme files for the first two I did because I didn't realize that I could just edit files into folders.

If you want to change the folder names you can just edit the folder name in the files. I believe the folder will
dissappear when you move everything out of it.
